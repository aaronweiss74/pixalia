# Pixalia #
Pixalia is a free, open source massively multiplayer online (MMO, thought it's actually not massive) game and thought experiment. It's based around the idea that people often don't realize how quickly they are judged, and included (or excluded) based on appearance. Admittedly, this was somewhat of an after-thought, and the game is mostly just a learning experience. This is the client for the game, the server is [currently unavailable](https://www.github.com/aaronweiss74).

### Requirements ###
* Maven, as a build system.
* Netty, for networking.
* LWJGL, for rendering.
* JInput, for input.
* Guava, for utilities.  
* SFL4J, for logging.  
n.b. Maven is nice enough to actually handle all of the dependencies.
