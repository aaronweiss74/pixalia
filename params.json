{"tagline":"The worst, best MMO client ever.","body":"# Pixalia #\r\nPixalia is a free, open source massively multiplayer online (MMO, thought it's actually not massive) game and thought experiment. It's based around the idea that people often don't realize how quickly they are judged, and included (or excluded) based on appearance. Admittedly, this was somewhat of an after-thought, and the game is mostly just a learning experience.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements ##\r\n* [Peter Atashian](https://www.github.com/retep998), for all of his help with OpenGL, and for motivation by being his usual egotistical self.\r\n* [Cedric Van Goethem](https://www.github.com/Zepheus), for helping with the design aspects, and with a lot of fun stuff early on, like raytracing. \r\n* [rice](https://www.github.com/wahlao), for the name, and some inspiration for the game.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
